# Around the U.S. project on React

## Featuring authorization and registration

### Description

This project is similar to my around-react project, the only difference is this one contains authorization and authentication on the client side using a jwt generated by a third party. I use local storage to store the jwt and the user will be logged in automatically as long as the jwt is saved inn local storage.
